WARNING
To avoid data loss, it is HIGHLY recommended that users stop any running
versions of this software before install updates. Internal changes are
always possible from one release to another.

BUILDING
 Setup the via a make.

 $ make

 Running a `make install-xxx` as root will distribute the files to the file-
 system.  Most users will want to select from three options depending on target
 init system (do not run both)!

  # make install-systemd-all
  # make install-upstart-all
  # make install-runit-all

 As of v3.13, the Makefiles for systemd-native distros such as Arch, Exherbo,
 and Fedora, no longer install the deprecated cron script using a systemd
 timer instead. Users may override and install the deprecated cron script by
 running make with `install-with-cron` instead  of `install` at this point.

UNINSTALL

 Run the uninstall make rule specific for your distro type. For Void, you
 would run:

  # make uninstall-runit-all

 In case you are updating, it will also run `make backup-conf`, allowing you
 to restore your previous config via `make restore-conf` after having re-run
 the appropriate install rule.
