BUILDING
 There is no configure script nor is there anything to compile.
 Copy or symlink the Makefile.x of your choosing to Makefile.

  $ ln -s Makefile.archlinux Makefile

 * Makefile.archlinux is setup for Archlinux.  
 * Makefile.ubuntu is setup for Debian/Mint/Ubuntu.

 Setup the via a make.

  $ make

 Running a `make install` as root will distribute the files to
 the filesystem.

  # make install

 As of v3.13, the Makefiles for systemd-native distros such as 
 Arch, Exherbo, and Fedora, no longer install the deprecated 
 cron script using a systemd timer instead. Users may override 
 and install the  depracated cron script by running make with 
 `install-with-cron` instead  of `install` at this point.
